# HEART_DISEASE
Machine learning models can be trained on datasets containing these attributes to predict heart disease
risk with high accuracy, often over 90%. The most predictive features are:
    
1. Age and sex - risk increases with age and is higher in males
2. Chest pain type - typical angina most indicative of heart disease
3. Resting ECG abnormalities - associated with heart disease
4. Exercise test results - exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and downsloping ST segment slope are positive signs

Other important features include:
5. Resting blood pressure - high blood pressure damages arteries
6. Serum cholesterol - high LDL narrows arteries
7. Fasting blood sugar - impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes ups risk

Machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVMs, and neural
networks can leverage these features to build predictive models for heart disease. The specific importance of
each feature depends on the model and dataset used. But in general, these attributes provide a robust set
of inputs for accurately predicting heart disease risk using machine learning techniques.
